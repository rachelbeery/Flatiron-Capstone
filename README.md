## Project Overview

This project uses regression analysis to study community resiliency and predicts hazard mitigation success. To reduce community damage, money, and resources spent we can increase our ROI through correct allocation of hazard mitigation funds. 

## Notebooks

Refer to the Capstone_Hazard_Mitigation and Capstone_Recovery notebooks as guides for Hazard Mitigation and Recovery Analysis

## Final Findings

- Hazard Mitigation
   - More funds should be allocated to hazard mitigation in all categories as natural disasters and subsequently recovery are increasing 

- Recovery
   - Budgets should be analyzed to understand what regions of the U.S. should receive more funding over other regions with higher risk to natural disaster costs
       - Alaska, DC, Arizona, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, Idaho
       - Coastal areas need more funding than those of the Mid West

- Less common Natural Disaster Preparedness
   - The costs of COVID-19 surpass all categories of natural disaster recovery costs
   - Volcanoes were second highest cost even though they are less common natural disaster


### Features of most importance in Hazard Mitigation

Better region planning would benefit hazard mitigation to reduce recovery costs. The states with the largest recovery cost include Alaska, D.C., Arizona, Louisiana, and Puerto Rico. These states and regions they are included in are all coastal areas with increased amount of natural disasters.

### Features of most importance in Recovery

In recent years (since 2015) Recovery costs have increased greatly due to increase in natural disaster damage. 2016 had the highest costs of recovery costs.

The following visual shows what Incident Type/Natural Disaster have the highest project amount.

Damage Category and project amounts for each were also a signicant indicator of how costly a recovery project would be.
