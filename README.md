## Project Overview

This project uses regression analysis to study the features of most importance in hazard mitigation success. To reduce community damage, money, and resources spent we can increase our ROI through correct allocation of hazard mitigation funds. 

## Notebooks

Refer to the Capstone_Hazard_Mitigation_Positive_ROI notebook as a guide for Hazard Mitigation and Recovery Analysis

## Final Findings

- Program Areas
   - More funds should be allocated to hazard mitigation in all categories of hazard mitigation with the HMGP being the most common program 

- Regions
   - Certain areas of the US are more prone to natural disasters and need more funding for hazard mitigation including 1, 2, 4, and 9 having the best ROI
   - Regions 6 & 7 having the lowest ROI

- Less common Natural Disaster Preparedness
   - The costs of COVID-19 surpass all categories of natural disaster recovery costs
          - Preparations could have been made to offset the extreme costs of COVID-19

### Regions of most importance in Hazard Mitigation

Better region planning would benefit hazard mitigation to reduce recovery costs. The regions with the largest recovery cost include 1, 2, 4, and 9. These regions are included in are all coastal areas with increased amount of natural disasters.

Regions 6 & 7 have the lowest ROI

### Features of most importance in Recovery

In recent years (since 2015) Recovery costs have increased greatly due to increase in natural disaster damage. 2016 had the highest costs of recovery costs.

The following visual shows what Incident Type/Natural Disaster have the highest project amount.

Damage Category and project amounts for each were also a signicant indicator of how costly a recovery project would be.
